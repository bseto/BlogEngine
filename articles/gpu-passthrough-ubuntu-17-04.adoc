= GPU Passthrough on Ubuntu 17.04

== Build Details
CPU: Ryzen 7, 1700
GPU (VM Passthrough): Nvidia GTX 1070
Motherboard: ASUS Strix B350

There are many articles on the internet that go over detailed steps on how to set up GPU passthrough so I will not repeat steps from those articles (Links below).
However, in this blog, I will describe problems I encountered during my set up, and the fixes for them.

Additional to the problems I encountered, the main focus of this blog will be the performance aspects of VM versus the baremetal setup, and what my overclocks on the CPU,
System Memory (RAM), and GPU overclocks do to affect benchmark and game scores
