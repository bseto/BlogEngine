== Introduction

I first started using Linux through VirtualBox on my Windows laptop - and I loved it.
However, as time went by, I noticed that the performance of the VM was not perfect.
Little graphical hiccups here and there tainted the otherwise flawless and open experience.
I eventually decided to abandoned the safety net of Windows, and started reading articles online on how to dualboot.
At the time, dualbooting was very daunting, I was worried that my laptop would forever lose the ability to power on,
or worse - that I'd spend all the time just to give up and go back to windows. 
Thankfully, after a couple days of having a bricked computer, and thinking that I had ruined my computer (haha), I came out of the experience 
proud to say that I had successfully dualbooted my laptop.

I eventually found that the annoying thing about this setup was that I'd have to reboot my computer any time I wanted to switch from coding to gaming.
Although the overhead of this reboot seems small, ideally, I wanted to be able to code on my side projects while waiting in game lobbies with my friends.
I didn't know of a better or different setup that was possible until I saw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuJYMCbIbPk[this] video from Linus Tech Tips, 
which then spun off and I started googling for linux + windows builds, which I eventually found https://davidyat.es/2016/09/08/gpu-passthrough/[here].

Sadly, I was in school so I couldn't be out of my laptop for a few days. And for some reason after reading these articles,
I had the notion that I'd have to run a hypervisor (maybe because Linus had used unRAID), which wasn't all that viable on a laptop.
It wasn't until I had prepared myself for the project a whole year later (August of 2017), that I realized I could have just ran Ubuntu
with a VM. 

There are already many existing articles online that detail the instructions on how to setup GPU passthrough with KVM on Linux. 
However, something I always found lacking in many articles is a good overview of instructions (which is why I thought I needed to run a hypervisor). 
The articles typically introduced requirents and then quickly jumped you straight into commands without really letting you know what the goal is.
Hopefully this guide can simplify the delivery, so you don't end up blindly copying commands until your VM boots up with a GPU passthrough haha.

== Overview

This section will hopefully simplify the entire setup.
If you find other blog posts kind of daunting, this section is probably a good place to start :).

Please note, this guide will be tailored to people with a similar setup to mine. +
I am running a first generation Ryzen 7 CPU, meaning it does not come with integrated graphics. 
What this means is it forces me to use a dedicated GPU for both my host and guest machine.

Some basic questions to get out of the way:

What is _KVM_?::
KVM stands for _Kernel Virtual Machine_. It is a loadable kernel module that will allow us to virtualize Windows. +
More details https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page[here]. +

What is _QEMU_?::
QEMU is an open source emulator and virtualizer. It can run off of the Xen hypervisor or KVM kernel module. +
In our case, we will be using it with the KVM kernel module. +

How are we going to be using QEMU/KVM?::
After we setup the system to make it GPU passthrough ready, we will setup the virtual machine using the QEMU/KVM's `virt-manager` GUI. +
However, there are some tweaks we will need to perform on the configuration file (which uses the xml schema) via the command `virsh`.


=== How do we start?


==== End Goal
Assuming we have all of the pre-requisites (detailed in the next section). 
I will be explaining what our end result is, and how we get there with some high level instructions.

If we do this properly, we will have Ubuntu 17.04 running baremetal on our computer, and we will also have a Windows 10 VM
running on QEMU/KVM with GPU passthrough.

==== High Level Steps
. *Ready our system for virtualization and GPU passthrough* + 
This involves checking that we meet the prerequisites, and things like having booted up with virtualization enabled in the bios. +

. *Determining the PCI ID of the GPU we want to passthrough to the VM.* +
The GPU will have an `ID` that specifies it in the system. We will need this `ID` later so we can specify it in the passthrough for QEMU's `virt-manager` GUI. +

. *Determining if the PCI ID is isolated in the IOMMU group* +
Although each of these PCI `ID`'s specify the part in the system. Many things are typically _grouped_ together in the system. +
For example, some of your USB controllers and Ethernet controller may be grouped together. +
So passing any of the `ID`'s within any of these groups, would require you to pass everything else in the group into the VM. +
Ideally, you'll be happy if your GPU is in it's own group by itself. +

. *pci-stub the GPU* +
We need to setup `pci-stub` to claim the GPU device at boot. pci-stub is pretty much a dummy driver. +
We want to avoid the kernel grabbing onto the GPU, so we can passthrough the GPU later. (Blacklisting the nvidia/amd driver will not work). +

. *Network* +
We want to setup a bridged network. This will allow the VM to have it's own IP. Important if we want to use _Synergy_ to control our VM. +

. *Setting up the VM* +
We will setup the VM (which is similar to VirtualBox's setup if you've ever used it). 
There will be no GPU passthrough on this step. It will be using Video Spice, which basically gives you a window to view +
the VM. 

. *Passthrough setup* +
After the VM is setup, we will finally passthrough the GPU to the VM. If it works - Hurrah!

Pretty simple if we really break it down like this. 
Most of the steps we do is just to make sure that our system is capable of performing the GPU passthrough.

=== Prerequisites

Assuming you are using the same hardware as I, then you won't have to read this section.

Your CPU has to support virtualization::
* Intel VT-x and Intel VT-d
* AMD-Vi

Motherboard must support IOMMU::
* Desktop

GPU that supports UEFI::
* According to https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Prerequisites[this], all GPU's from 2012 and later should support this.

=== Recommendations

* If you are running Ryzen, you will need two GPU's - preferrably one Nvidia, and one AMD (This will make things much easier).
* Ubuntu or your Linux is installed to boot via UEFI.
* The graphics card you want to passthrough to windows should not be the one used during boot. For example, I read that my
